# Card Game

This game is deployed and is playable here: https://revelation218.com/

This is a large side project I have been working on since early 2020.
It is a two-player deck-building card game (like Dominion) which is playable online (like Hearthstone).
Think Slay the Spire meets Magic: The Gathering.

Please note, the game is a work in progress, and there are many things I would like to change.
In particular there is currently no artwork, and whilst there are some automated tests, there are not nearly as many as I would like.

## Some technical details

The bulk of the game is written in Java 15, and the front end is written in React.
It's deployed with docker compose and uses mongo to store account data.

The core of the game is an event bus, which drives all interactions in the game.
When the player plays a card (or performs any other action), an event is fired, which may cause the game state to change (e.g. by damaging the opponent, drawing cards, purchasing them, creating structures).

Card behaviour is defined as data, which allows for fast iteration.

For instance, [this card](https://github.com/jrhodkinson/card-game/blob/master/card-game-implementation/src/main/resources/assets/cards/money/ill-gotten-gains.json):
```json
{
  "id": "ILL_GOTTEN_GAINS",
  "name": "Ill-gotten Gains",
  "cost": 2,
  "purchasable": true,
  "behaviours": [
    [
      "damageOnPurchase",
      {
        "amount": 3,
        "targets": ["OTHER"]
      }
    ],
    [
      "money",
      2
    ]
  ]
}

```

Ill-gotten Gains composes the behaviours `damageOnPurchase` and `money`.
A description is automatically generated for the card ("On purchase, damage your opponent 3. Acquire 2M."), and the behaviours are implemented here:
- [DamageOnPurchaseBehaviour](https://github.com/jrhodkinson/card-game/blob/master/card-game-implementation/src/main/java/jrh/game/card/behaviour/DamageOnPurchaseBehaviour.java)
- [MoneyBehaviour](https://github.com/jrhodkinson/card-game/blob/master/card-game-implementation/src/main/java/jrh/game/card/behaviour/MoneyBehaviour.java)
