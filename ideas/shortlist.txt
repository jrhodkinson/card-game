Inflation: All cards now cost 1 more
Temperance: Gain 5, you may not attack this turn
Regulate: All cards cost 3
Cartel: Worth a traingular / square number depending how many you have
Duplicate a card -> need to target a card -> behaviour needs to be able to say what type of entity it targets
Black market: private shop, just for you
Brewery: combat down 1, but every turn add a beer to your hand:
    - different types: ale, mead, etc
    - varying effects, all vanish
    - maybe must play?
Harbour: must attack, increases gold for turn by X
